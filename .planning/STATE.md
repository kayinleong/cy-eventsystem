**Current milestone:** v1
**Last updated:** 2026-05-24 (initialization)

## Phase tracker

| Phase | ID | Status | Started | Completed |
|-------|----|----|---------|-----------|
| 1 | `phase-kayinleong-01` (UI POC) | Not started | — | — |
| 2 | `phase-kayinleong-02` (Functionality) | Not started | — | — |

## Current focus

**Next step:** `/gsd-plan-phase 1` — create detailed PLAN.md for the UI POC phase.

## Notes

- Repo was pre-initialized by user with `npx create-next-app` (Next 16.2.6) and `npx shadcn init` (v4 radix-nova/neutral) before GSD bootstrap.
- One shadcn component already installed: `components/ui/button.tsx`.
- `.env.local` does not exist and is not needed until Phase 2 Block A.
- No git history before this initialization commit.
- Per global CLAUDE.md, the owner-slug is `kayinleong` (derived from `ka.yin.leong`).
- All claim IDs and commit prefixes use the `phase-kayinleong-NN` / `quick-kayinleong-NNN` form.

## Open clarifications (carried into Phase 2 planning)

These do not block Phase 1 but should be answered before Phase 2 work begins in earnest:

1. Existing barcodes the customer needs to scan vs all-new labels?
2. Expected inventory volume? (Affects index strategy + listener cost.)
3. Email delivery: Firebase built-in for invites + low-stock — sufficient, or need SendGrid?
4. Photo storage scope: item photos? Damage attachments? Affects Storage rules + CDN.
5. `next-firebase-auth-edge` v1.12 stability — validate with a 1-day spike at start of Phase 2.
